<h2>Summary </h2>
This game was my submission for the 48hr  <a href="https://itch.io/jam/gmtk-2021/rate/1081726">GMTK  2021</a> Gam Jam.
The prompt was "linked together".I took that idea and made 2 orbs linked together that needed to move together to get through the levels.

 <h2>made with Unity. </h2>
